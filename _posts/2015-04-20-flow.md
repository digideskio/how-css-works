There is no such thing as an **unstyled** HTML document. Each browser comes with a default CSS: the **user agent stylesheet**.

The default styling relies upon the HTML **structure**: the content's length, how elements are nested, in which order they appear in the code...

### Fluidity

In HTML, the **content** is King.

All `block` elements are **fluid**. They will naturally adapt their layout to accommodate their inner content:

* **width: 100%**  
a block will take up the whole width available
* **word wrap**  
if a block's inline content doesn't fit on a single line, it will continue on a new line
* **height: auto**  
a block's height varies automatically to match its content's size

<div class="browser">
  <div class="browser-bar">
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="browser-body">
    <div class="block block-alpha">
      A block element will fill up the whole <strong>width</strong> available, while its <strong>height</strong> will vary automatically according to the size of its content.
      <br>
      <span data-typer-targets="You can add even more text,This block will continue expanding,This line is most probably long enough to trigger a new one by wrapping the text"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="block block-beta">
      This element will be pushed downwards depending on the height of its predecessors.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<aside>
  A <code>block</code> is by default in <strong>full width</strong>.
  <br>
  Its <strong>height</strong> is the height of its content.
</aside>

### Ordering

HTML elements are displayed in the **order** in which they are written **in the code**.  
First in the code -> first in the browser.

<div class="browser">
  <div class="browser-bar">
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="browser-body">
    <div class="block block-alpha">
      First
    </div>
    <div class="block block-beta">
      Second
    </div>
    <div class="block block-gamma">
      Third
    </div>
    <div class="block block-delta">
      Fourth
    </div>
    <div class="block block-epsilon">
      Fifth
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<aside>
  Each <code>block</code> appears in the order in which they appear in the HTML code, from <strong>top</strong> to <strong>bottom</strong>.
</aside>

### Stacking

A browser has **3 dimensions**.

Each HTML element belongs to an imaginary **layer**.

The **stack order** depends on how elements are **nested**: child elements appear **on top** of their respective parents.

<div class="browser">
  <div class="browser-bar">
    <div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="browser-body">
    <div class="block block-alpha">
      This parent is behind
      <div class="block block-beta">
        This nested child is on top of its parent
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="block block-gamma">
      The nesting level
      <div class="block block-delta">
        is not
          <div class="block block-epsilon">
            relevant
          </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<aside>
  Each <strong>nested</strong> element appears <strong>on top</strong> of its parent.
  <br>
  The <strong>deeper</strong> in the hierarchy, the <strong>higher</strong> in the stack.
</aside>

### Breaking the flow

While the browser's default behavior is _efficient_, it may not be _sufficient_ for your design needs.

Several CSS properties allow to **disrupt** the Flow:

* `height` and `width` can alter an element's **fluidity**
* `float` **disrupts** an element's behavior as well as its surroundings
* `position` `absolute` and `fixed` **remove** an element from the Flow
* `z-index` can alter the order in which elements are **stacked**
